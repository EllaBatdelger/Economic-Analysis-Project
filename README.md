# Economic-Analysis-Project
Overview: This project is about analyzing unemployment trends across different states using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API and some web scraping. I used Python and its libraries to collect, clean, and analyze the data, then created visualizations to make the findings clear and useful. 
### Key Features
- **API Integration**: Pulled data automatically using the FRED API.
- **Web Scraping**: Added extra data by scraping websites.
- **Data Cleaning**: Made sure the data was accurate and consistent using tools like Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Looked for patterns and insights in the data.
- **Visualization**: Created clear visuals of unemployment trends by state using Matplotlib and Plotly.
- **Stakeholder Insights**: Highlighted the key takeaways and what they mean for decision-makers.

### Libraries and Tools
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For cleaning and organizing data.
- **NumPy**: For working with numbers and calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly**: For creating charts and graphs.
- **Requests**: To connect to the FRED API.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping extra data.

### What I Learned
- How to automate data collection with APIs.
- How to clean and organize large sets of data.
- How to create visuals that make data easy to understand.
- How to explore data and find interesting trends.
- How to handle challenges in data analysis with creativity and persistence.

### About Me
I love working with data and figuring out how to make sense of it. This project shows my interest in economic trends and my ability to turn numbers into insights. I’m always looking to learn more and work on exciting projects. Let’s connect if you’re interested!

### Future Improvements
- Adding more economic data for a deeper analysis.
- Building interactive dashboards to make the data even easier to explore.
- Using machine learning to predict future trends.
