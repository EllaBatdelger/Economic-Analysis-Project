# Economic-Analysis-Project
This project is about analyzing unemployment trends across different states using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API and some web scraping. I used Python and its libraries to collect, clean, and analyze the data, then created visualizations to make the findings clear and useful.
